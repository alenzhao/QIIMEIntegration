Alignment template file path

Contains pre-aligned sequences specific to known, related OTUs.

Generally a built in file...

/macqiime/greengenes/gg_13_8_otus/rep_set/97_otus.fasta for bacterial ribosomal 16S subunit sequences

If you are using fungal ITS data, there is not a good pre-made alignment to use here.  We suggest using MUSCLE instead and aligning without a template.
Unfortunately, doing so may take a long time.
