<p>This is the final step in QIIME's OTU analysis.  It creates a table that stores read counts per OTU for each sample. The file it creates can be exported to various other software packages for further analysis</p>

<p><strong>Here are scripts to execute before this one</strong>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="displayHideables('pick_otus')">Pick OTUs</a> - This script uses an OTU map file (each line is an OTU, each column is a read), which is generated by pick OTUs</li>
<li><a onclick="displayHideables('assign_taxonomy')">Assign taxonomy</a> - If you want to include real-world taxa in your OTU table, you must first assign your OTUs</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Here are the main decisions you should make before running this script</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select your input --otu_map_file (the result of Pick OTUs)</li>
<li>Specify a taxonomy file, if you have created one</li>
<li>Decide if you want to exclude any OTUs.  If you do, create a plain text file with one OTU per line, and upload it for use in the paramter --exclude_otus_fp</li>
<li>Pick output options</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><strong>Here are the scripts to run after this one</strong>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="displayHideables('manipulate_table')">Manipulate OTU table</a> - Once you have created your OTU table, you can run various commands on it, for example, file format conversion</li>
<li><a onclick="displayHideables('align_seqs')">Sequence alignment</a> - Now you may want to go on to perform phylgeny analysis </li>
</ul>
</p>
