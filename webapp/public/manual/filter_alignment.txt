Usage: filter_alignment.py [options] {-i/--input_fasta_file INPUT_FASTA_FILE}

[] indicates optional input (order unimportant)
{} indicates required input (order unimportant)

This script should be applied to generate a useful tree when aligning against a template alignment (e.g., with PyNAST). This script will remove positions which are gaps in every sequence (common for PyNAST, as typical sequences cover only 200-400 bases, and they are being aligned against the full 16S gene). Additionally, the user can supply a lanemask file, that defines which positions should included when building the tree, and which should be ignored. Typically, this will differentiate between non-conserved positions, which are uninformative for tree building, and conserved positions which are informative for tree building. FILTERING ALIGNMENTS WHICH WERE BUILD WITH PYNAST AGAINST THE GREENGENES CORE SET ALIGNMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL STEP.

Example usage: 
Print help message and exit
 filter_alignment.py -h

Examples: As a simple example of this script, the user can use the following command, which consists of an input FASTA file (i.e. resulting file from align_seqs.py), lanemask template file and the output directory "filtered_alignment/"
 filter_alignment.py -i seqs_rep_set_aligned.fasta -m lanemask_in_1s_and_0s -o filtered_alignment/

Alternatively, if the user would like to use a different gap fraction threshold ("-g"), they can use the following command
 filter_alignment.py -i seqs_rep_set_aligned.fasta -m lanemask_in_1s_and_0s -o filtered_alignment/ -g 0.95

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Print information during execution -- useful for
                        debugging [default: False]
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output_dir=OUTPUT_DIR
                        the output directory [default: .]
  -m LANE_MASK_FP, --lane_mask_fp=LANE_MASK_FP
                        path to lanemask file [default:
                        /macqiime/greengenes/lanemask_in_1s_and_0s]
  -s, --suppress_lane_mask_filter
                        suppress lane mask filtering (necessary to turn off
                        lane-mask-based filtering when a qiime_config default
                        is  provided for --lane_mask_fp) [default: False]
  -g ALLOWED_GAP_FRAC, --allowed_gap_frac=ALLOWED_GAP_FRAC
                        gap filter threshold, filters positions which are gaps
                        in > allowed_gap_frac of the sequences [default:
                        0.999999]
  -r, --remove_outliers
                        remove seqs very dissimilar to the alignment consensus
                        (see --threshold).  [default: False]
  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold=THRESHOLD
                        with -r, remove seqs whose dissimilarity to the
                        consensus sequence is approximately > x standard
                        devaitions above the mean of the sequences [default:
                        3.0]
  -e ENTROPY_THRESHOLD, --entropy_threshold=ENTROPY_THRESHOLD
                        Sets percent threshold for removing base positions
                        with the highest entropy.  For example, if 0.10 were
                        specified, the top 10% most entropic base positions
                        would be filtered.  If this value is used, any lane
                        mask supplied will be ignored.  Entropy filtered
                        occurs after gap filtering.    [default: none]

  REQUIRED options:
    The following options must be provided under all circumstances.

    -i INPUT_FASTA_FILE, --input_fasta_file=INPUT_FASTA_FILE
                        the input directory  [REQUIRED]
