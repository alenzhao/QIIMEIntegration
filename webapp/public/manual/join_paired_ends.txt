Usage: join_paired_ends.py [options] {-f/--forward_reads_fp FORWARD_READS_FP -r/--reverse_reads_fp REVERSE_READS_FP -o/--output_dir OUTPUT_DIR}

[] indicates optional input (order unimportant)
{} indicates required input (order unimportant)

This script takes forward and reverse Illumina reads and joins them using the method chosen. Will optionally create an updated index reads file containing index reads for the surviving joined paired end reads. If the option to write an updated index file is chosen, be sure that the order and header format of the index reads is the same as the order and header format of reads in the files that will be joined (this is the default for reads generated on the Illumina instruments).

Currently, there are two methods that can be selected by the user to join paired-end data:

1. fastq-join - Erik Aronesty, 2011. ea-utils : "Command-line tools for processing biological sequencing data" (http://code.google.com/p/ea-utils)

2. SeqPrep - (https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep)


Example usage: 
Print help message and exit
 join_paired_ends.py -h

Join paired-ends with 'fastq-join': This is the default method to join paired-end Illumina data
 join_paired_ends.py -f $PWD/forward_reads.fastq -r $PWD/reverse_reads.fastq -o $PWD/fastq-join_joined

Join paired-ends with 'SeqPrep': Produces similar output to the 'fastq-join' but returns data in gzipped format.
 join_paired_ends.py -m SeqPrep -f $PWD/forward_reads.fastq -r $PWD/reverse_reads.fastq -o $PWD/SeqPrep_joined

Update the index / barcode reads file to match the surviving joined pairs.: This is required if you will be using 'split_libraries_fastq.py'.
 join_paired_ends.py -f $PWD/forward_reads.fastq -r $PWD/reverse_reads.fastq -b $PWD/barcodes.fastq -o $PWD/fastq-join_joined

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Print information during execution -- useful for
                        debugging [default: False]
  -m PE_JOIN_METHOD, --pe_join_method=PE_JOIN_METHOD
                        Method to use for joining paired-ends. Valid choices
                        are: fastq-join, SeqPrep [default: fastq-join]
  -b INDEX_READS_FP, --index_reads_fp=INDEX_READS_FP
                        Path to the barcode / index reads in FASTQ format.
                        Will be filtered based on surviving joined pairs.
  -j MIN_OVERLAP, --min_overlap=MIN_OVERLAP
                        Applies to both fastq-join and SeqPrep methods.
                        Minimum allowed overlap in base-pairs required to join
                        pairs. If not set, progam defaults will be used. Must
                        be an integer. [default: none]
  -p PERC_MAX_DIFF, --perc_max_diff=PERC_MAX_DIFF
                        Only applies to fastq-join method, otherwise ignored.
                        Maximum allowed % differences within region of
                        overlap. If not set, progam defaults will be used.
                        Must be an integer between 1-100 [default: none]
  -y MAX_ASCII_SCORE, --max_ascii_score=MAX_ASCII_SCORE
                        Only applies to SeqPrep method, otherwise ignored.
                        Maximum quality score / ascii code allowed to appear
                        within joined pairs output. For more information,
                        please see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format.
                        [default: J]
  -n MIN_FRAC_MATCH, --min_frac_match=MIN_FRAC_MATCH
                        Only applies to SeqPrep method, otherwise ignored.
                        Minimum allowed fraction of matching bases required to
                        join reads. Must be a float between 0-1. If not set,
                        progam defaults will be used. [default: none]
  -g MAX_GOOD_MISMATCH, --max_good_mismatch=MAX_GOOD_MISMATCH
                        Only applies to SeqPrep method, otherwise ignored.
                        Maximum mis-matched high quality bases allowed to join
                        reads. Must be a float between 0-1. If not set, progam
                        defaults will be used. [default: none]
  -6 PHRED_64, --phred_64=PHRED_64
                        Only applies to SeqPrep method, otherwise ignored. Set
                        if input reads are in phred+64 format. Output will
                        always be phred+33. [default: False]
