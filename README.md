QIIMEIntegration
================

I am working on incorporating QIIME into a workspace-specific pipeline.  I keep notes and useful scripts here.

1. Installation
 * I used MacQIIME (http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime) for easy installation.  Out of box, most everything worked fine. 
 * Because I work with paired-end sequencing data, I included fastq-join as well (http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime/add-fastq-join-to-macqiime-1-8-0/Add_ea-tools_to_MacQIIME-1.8.0.tgz?attredirects=0&d=1)
