<p><strong>Here are scripts to execute before this one</strong>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="displayHideables('join_paried_ends')">Join paired ends</a> - This script can manage either paired end, single end, or combined .fastq files. The rest of QIIME cannot handle non-joined paired-ends. You can run Join paired ends either before, or after this script.  If you run it before, use --input_type = paired_end_stitched</li>
<li><a onclick="displayHideables('validate_mapping_file')">Validate mapping file</a> - This script optionally takes a mapping file as input.  You should validate it before you use it here</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Here are the main decisions you should make before running this script</strong>
<ol>
<li>Pick your --input_type</li>
<li>Specify your one or two input .fastq files (depends on --input_type)</li>
<li>Decide on barcode options<ul>
	<li>Length of one or both barcodes</li>
	<li>Do you want to attempt reordering based on a map file?</li>
</ul>If working with two .fastq files, do you want to --disable_header_match</li>
<li>Pick output options<ul>
	<li>Do you want to reverse complement barcodes before printing them?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><strong>Here are the scripts to run after this one</strong>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="displayHideables('split_libraries_fastq')">De-multiplex libraries (fastq)</a> - This script generates a new .fastq file that has just barcodes as its sequences</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Here are some of the common pitfalls using this script</strong>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to specify the correct barcode length. The default length is 6 bases, which is frequently incorrect</li>
<li>You may have to reverse complement the barcodes. We recommend using a --mapping_fp to perform the orientation for you.<ul>
<li>If you have paired ends, this only works if your map file has ReversePrimers</li></ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
